INSERT INTO burgers (burger_name, devoured)
VALUES ("good burger", 0), ("bad burger", 0), ("ugly burger", 0);

-- So I was wrong, but right. Apparently, this isn't about letting you add multiple columns to multiple tables, though that's probably a side benefit and what I'll use it for in future? It also lets you seperate out your prototypes, your 'seeds', if you will, from the user generated data. Thanks, Jared.
